It's getting to the point 
Where I'm no fun anymore 
I am sorry 
Sometimes it hurts so badly 
I must cry out loud 
I am lonely 
I am yours, you are mine 
You are what you are 
You make it hard 
Remember what we've said and done and felt 
About each other 
Oh babe, have mercy 
Don't let the past remind us of 
What we are not now 
I am not dreamin' 
I am yours, you are mine 
You are what you are 
You make it hard 
Tearin' yourself away from me now 
You are free and I am crying 
This does not mean 
I don't love you 
I do, that's forever
Yes and for always 
I am yours, you are mine 
You are what you are 
You make it hard 
Something inside is telling me that I've got your secret 
Are you still listening? 
Fear is the lock 
And laughter the key to your heart 
And I love you 
I am yours, you are mine 
You are what you are
You make it hard 
And you make it hard 
And you make it hard 
And you make it hard 
Friday evenin', Sunday in the afternoon 
What have you got to lose? 
Tuesday mornin', please be gone, I'm tired of you 
What have you got to lose? 
Can I tell it like it is? 
(Help me I'm suffering) 
Listen to me baby 
It's my heart that's a suffering 
(Help me I'm dying) 
It's a dying, that's what I have to lose 
I've got an answer 
I'm going to fly away 
What have I got to lose? 
Will you come see me Thursdays and Saturdays? 
(Baby baby baby) 
What have you got to lose? 
Chestnut brown canary 
Ruby throated sparrow 
Sing the song, don't be long 
Thrill me to the marrow 
Voices of the angels, ring around the moonlight 
Asking me, said she so free 
How can you catch the sparrow? 
Lacy, lilting, leery, losing love, lamenting 
Change my life, make it right 
Be my lady 
¡Que linda! Me recuerda a Cuba 
La reina de la Mar Caribe Quiero sólo visitarla allí 
Y que triste que no puedo. ¡Vaya! 
O Va! O Va!
