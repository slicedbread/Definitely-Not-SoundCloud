Mama, take this badge from me
I can't use it any more
It's getting dark, too dark to see
I'm feelin' like I'm knocking on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on Heaven's door
Mama, put my guns in the ground
I can't shoot them any more
That long cold black cloud is coming down
I'm feelin' like I'm knocking on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on Heaven's door
Knock, knock, knocking on Heaven's door, ooh yeah
Knock, knock, knocking on Heaven's door
