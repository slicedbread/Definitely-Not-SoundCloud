Hearts of fire creates love desire
Take you high and higher to the world you belong
Hearts of fire creates love desire
High and higher to your place on the throne
We’ve come together on this special day
To sing our message loud and clear
Looking back we’ve touched on sorrowful days
Future pass, they disappear
You will find peace of mind
If you look way down in your heart and soul
Don’t hesitate ‘cause the world seems cold
Stay young at heart ‘cause you’re never, never old at heart
That’s the way of the world
Plant your flower and you grow a pearl
A child is born with a heart of gold
The way of the world makes his heart grow cold
Hearts of fire creates love desire
Take you high and higher to the world you belong
Hearts of fire, love desire
High and higher, you, you, you
Hearts of fire, love desire
High and higher
We’ve came together on this special day
To sing our message loud and clear
Looking back we’ve touched on sorrowful days
Well, future disappear
You will find peace of mind
If you look way down in your heart and soul
Don’t hesitate ‘cause the world seems cold
Stay young at heart ‘cause you’re never, never, never old at heart
That’s the way of the world
Plant your flowers and you grow a pearl
A child is born with a heart of gold
The way of the world makes his heart grow cold
And love, and love, and love, and love
And love, and love, and love
Well the love, the love, the love
Darlin' lovely, don't you hear me now?
Don't you hear me now?
Darlin', won't you hear me now, won't you hear me now?
Hearts of fire, love desire
High and higher, you, you, you
Hearts of fire, love desire
